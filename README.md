# Automation tools for Linux

Experimental repo, exploring automation for Linux.

Mostly for own use or tiny office situations for now, without the pretention to go anywhere.

Let's start looking into:
 - Opening, editing, combining files in odf format
 - Window management & placement
 - Managing & watching folders, directories
